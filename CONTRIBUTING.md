hey guys , 
if you want contribute to this repository , it would be a great help .
do remember to be respectful to any other contributors and fell free to ask any doubts , i would love to answer them .
there are two issues i have opened in this repo :
1. you can add shell scipt programs of your own .
2. you can update the readme.md file as a non code contribution.
